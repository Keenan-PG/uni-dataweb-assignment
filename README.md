# Data & Web final assignment
University final 1st year assignment. No Frameworks allowed. :) 

Decided to go for a object-oriented approach.

### Explained
- assets - images etc
- public - customer facing side of site
- admin - admin facing side of site
- classes - classes for customer & admins
- config - db connection & creating objects - passing connection to them (to access front end)
